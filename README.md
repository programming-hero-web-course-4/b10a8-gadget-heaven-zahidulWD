# Gadget Heaven (Assignment-8)

Gadget Heaven Project (Assignment-08) is an e-commerce website. In this project I am using ReactJS and React-Router.
We are bringing various products to the website using fake data. And the products are added to the add to card button. Adding a demo section.


## React Fundamental Concept in My Project:

- **Components**:


- **State Management**:


- **Routing**:


- **Conditional Rendering**:


- **Local Storage**:


- **Props**



- **Toast Notifications**




## In my project, I have utilized the following methods for handling and managing data:
- Local Storage
- Context API (Planned)

## 5 features of my website/project:
- *Product Listings:*
    - The website displays a list of products, allowing users to browse through various items with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.

- *Cart Functionality:*
    - Users can add products to their shopping cart. The cart maintains a persistent state using local storage, so items remain in the cart even after page refreshes.

- *Wishlist Feature:*
    - Users can add products to a wishlist, which is also stored in local storage. This allows users to save items for later consideration.

- *Dynamic Cart and Wishlist Counts:*
    - The navbar displays real-time counts of items in the cart and wishlist, providing users with immediate feedback on their selections.

- *Sort Products by Price:*
    - Users can sort the products in their cart by price, allowing them to view items in ascending or descending order based on their price.
